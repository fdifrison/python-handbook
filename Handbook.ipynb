Neither using `del module_name` is enough because we are only deleting the name reference from the namespace. What we need to do is to delete the memory reference in the `sys.module` dictionary: `del sys.module['module_name']` . Now if we re-import the module, we are creating a new object, with a new `id`.\n",

However, care must be taken when reloading modules, for example, if we are loading only a specific function of a module to the namespace, let's say `from math import sqrt` we can directly reload the module since we don't have the name `math` in the namespace, but we'll have to refer to the sys.module reference -> `imporlib.reload(sys.module[math])`. However, even if `math` has been now reloaded, the same is not happened for the `sqrt` function. To do taht we would have needed to do something like `sqrt = sys.module[math].sqrt`.

In fact, the code goes inside the `__init__.py` file inside the directory, and the pair `directory + __ini__.py` compose a `module`.

    "---\n",
    "Iterables are, in essence, containers that can be iterated, nothing more. For example, sequences are particular iterables upon which we can iterate on an index-base, but this is not always the case for an iterbale. An iterable only need the concept of `next` item, meaning that it should return another element from the container, without any ordering implied. Moreover iterators needs to keep track of the elements that have been handed out, since we don't want the same element twice, and a stopping creterion is needed to tell us when the container is exhausted and no more elements are available. Other features are: having a finite number of elements in the container, the possibility to \"start from the beginning\" i.e. reuse the iterable if needed, the use of list comprehension etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a special method called `next()` that lives under `__next__` and fit exaclty the purpose of iteraring over an iterable, i.e handing out a new elemnt each time it is called on an iterable. We also have a built-in exception that is made to check if the iterable is exhausted, this is `StopIteration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we want to create our custom iterable class, how can we tell Python how to behave properly on the `__next__` method? how to not exhaust our class instance once we have iterated over all the elements? \n",
    "To answer this we need to use a **`protocol`** i.e. a way to tell to the python interpreter that our class has to implement certain functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, for an `iterator` we need a `iterator protocol` that requires the class to have 2 methods:\n",
    "* `__iter__` a method that should only return the class instance (why???)\n",
    "* `__next__` to handle the elements return and the eventual raise of StopIteration\n",
    "\n",
    "If our class satify this prerequisite than we have an **`iterator`** upon which we can use for loops, list comprehension etc.. except for the reusability of the iterable, once it is consumed it has to be reinstaciated.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, the solution to our problem is to have two distinct objects: the `iterable` that is the collection of the elements, it never get exhausted, it is just a container; and the `iterator`, a copy of the iterable object that is responsible for iterating over the elements. the iterable is created once while the iterator is created any time we want to restart the iterating process. This is a good deal form amny reasons, for example we may have a use set of data stored in our iteable and we don't want to reload them each time we need to restart the iteration!\n",
    "\n",

We could for sure iterate over the whole list, but a more clever way is to apply a predicate to the list and then check the content with `all()`.

A classical example is the `with` statement used while, for example, open a file; in this case we create a `context` that it is specifically design to handle the file, we `enter` the context opening the file, we `work` in the contex while manipulating the file and we `exit` the context closing the file (escaping the 'with' indentation).\n",

    "## Context Manager Decorator\n",
    "One of the driver that pushed the Python community do develope the context management constructor was the ability to handle the context of generator functions. Essentially what we need to create a context manager from a generator function is to trap the entering and exiting of the context with a tyr-finally , where 'try' has the duty to yield values from the generator and 'finally' has to clean up the context. We can than build a context manager class that takes as argument an instance of our generator function and implementxs the context manager protocol; on enter we will call `next` on the generator to open the file, on exit we need another try-except to call again next to exhaust the generator, therefore closing the file, and trap the `StopIteration` exception that the generator would naturally raise. This is it, we are able to use a generator with a proper context manager. To simplify the process, python has a built-in standard library `contextlib.contextmanager`, which is a decorator that turns generator functions into context manager."

In principles, we can serialize any kind of object and this mainly depend by the serialization mechanism we will adopt. Python for example has a specific serialization mechanism called `pickle` which use a binary representaion (non-human readable). Other example are databases (sql and NOsql) or JSON which are essentially text representation and therefore more limited in the datatypes they can serialize/deserialize, but with the advantage of being human readable.\n"

However, if we want to retain particular object while decoding we need do work around the json limitations.\n",

We could encode a single object as a dictionary that contains two keys, one for the value and one for the object type. When deconding to a dictionary, then we can iterate over and replace the the two key-value pairs with the exact object. But this is a tedious approach and difficult to carry out recursively.\n",

In this way the recursion is hadled for us.\n",

    "An alternative is to use `object-pairs_hook` (is an alternative to *object_hook*, we cannot specify both the arguments); the difference is that instead of passing the deserialized dictionary (for whom the keys order is not guaranteed) it pass a list o tuples that contains the key-value paris, and since list are guaranteed to retin order, so it will be for the keys in the tuples.\n",

A samrt way to approach this is to write our custom decoding class and inside it use the default `json.loads` as a first step to return al least the basic python objects (list, dictionaries etc..) and then work on this result leveragin python methods."

To declarea **private** attribute double underscore **self.__attribute** are used, but again the privacy is only apparent since python is only a `name mangling`, i.e. it is replacing the attribute name with `_className__attributeName`; of course the protection on that attribute is stronger, but we are still not strickly talking about a private variable."
